        # Example: execute a terminal command
        self.chat_interface.send_message(f"Executing command: {user_input}")

```

This is the code for the `AutonomousMode` class in `autonomous_mode.py`. The `AutonomousMode` class is responsible for running autonomous tasks based on user input. It starts a separate thread that continuously checks for user input and processes it accordingly.

The `start` method starts the autonomous mode by creating a new thread and calling the `run` method. The `run` method is the main loop of the autonomous mode, which checks for user input and processes it. The `stop` method stops the autonomous mode by setting the `running` flag to `False` and joining the thread.

The `process_user_input` method is where you can define the logic for autonomous tasks based on user input. In this example, it simply sends a message to the chat interface indicating that a command is being executed, and then executes the command (the actual code to execute the command is not shown here). Finally, it sends a message indicating that the command was executed successfully.

You can customize the `process_user_input` method to perform any autonomous tasks you want based on the user input.
