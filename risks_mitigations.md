### **Risks and Mitigations**

- **Complexity**: The project involves integrating various technologies. Mitigation involves iterative development and testing.
- **Security Risks**: Secure data transmission and storage. Mitigation involves using encryption and secure APIs.

To mitigate the risks associated with the complexity of the project, we will follow an iterative development approach. This means that we will break down the development process into smaller, manageable tasks and work on them incrementally. By doing so, we can identify and address any issues or challenges early on, reducing the overall complexity of the project.

To ensure the security of data transmission and storage, we will implement encryption algorithms and secure API interactions. This will protect sensitive user information and prevent unauthorized access to the application and its data. Additionally, we will use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to establish secure connections between the application and external endpoints.

By implementing these risk mitigation strategies, we aim to minimize the impact of potential risks and ensure the successful development and deployment of the MacOS application.
